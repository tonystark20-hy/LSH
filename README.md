# PySpark Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH)
This PySpark implementation demonstrates Locality Sensitive Hashing, a technique used for approximate nearest neighbor search in high-dimensional spaces. It leverages PySpark's distributed computing capabilities to efficiently identify candidate pairs of similar items.

## Overview
Locality Sensitive Hashing aims to hash similar items into the same buckets with high probability. This PySpark implementation distributes the hashing process across a cluster of machines, allowing for scalable and parallel computation.

## Features
* LSH Functions: Define and implement multiple hash functions that map similar items to the same buckets.
* Minhashing: Generate hash signatures for items using the Minhash technique to estimate Jaccard similarity.
* PySpark RDDs: Utilize PySpark's Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs) to perform LSH on large datasets in a distributed environment.
* Candidate Pair Identification: Identify potential pairs of similar items based on their hash signatures.
## Prerequisites
* Python installed in your environment.
* Apache Spark and PySpark set up on your local machine or a cluster.
